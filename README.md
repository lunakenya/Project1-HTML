## Problem Statement

Minimarket "Full Ahorro" faces challenges in managing its inventory due to the current manual process, which causes inefficiencies and human errors. An automated system is required to allow administrators to:

1. Add new products.
2. Update the quantity of existing products.
3. View the list of available products and their quantities.

The goal is to create a simple and efficient system that ensures precise inventory management, maintaining adequate stock levels and avoiding shortages or excesses of products.

### Proposed Solution

Implement an application based on microservices, divided into two main parts:

### 1. Backend

- **Product Service:** Responsible for handling the creation, updating, and querying of products.

### 2. Frontend

- **Web Application:** User interface for administrators to interact with the product service, registering new products and updating the quantity of existing ones.
